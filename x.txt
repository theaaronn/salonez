I need the flow for admin to see the reservations active, going from login with credentials admin
The flow for the owner, which involves creating a hall and see the reservations made to that hall
The flow for user, which involves cancelling and reserving a place 

Keep the credentials as admin, owner and user respectively, this is for a demo
